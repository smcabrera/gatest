    This is a test to figure out how to fix the issues we're having with the pfl site.<br>
    The issue we're having at the moment is that events that happen on the mobile.
    site are not registered as goals on the desktop site profile.

    We're doing basically eight tests:
  <ol>
    <li>page views and events</li>
    <li>google tag manager versus manually written code</li>
    <li>A google analytics "mobile" profile and a "desktop" one</li>
  </ol>
